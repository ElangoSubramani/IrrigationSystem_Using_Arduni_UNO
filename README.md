The Smart Irrigation System that we presented at the exhibition is designed to optimize irrigation schedules and conserve water resources. IoT devices such as sensors and weather stations collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and weather conditions, which is then analyzed by AI algorithms to determine the optimal irrigation schedule. This approach not only leads to more efficient use of water resources but also improves crop yields. Additionally, the Smart Irrigation System also alerts farmers to potential issues such as leaks or clogs in the irrigation system, allowing them to address the problem before it becomes a major issue.
